## es5 boilerplate
Super minimal es5 boilerplate using a gulp build system.

Builds a project from a src directory into a dist directory. All JS will be concatenated and minified.

##### Usage
> `gulp` - builds the system to the dist directory and starts watchers for html, css and js.
>
> Customize the build process by adding tasks to the gulp/tasks directory, or add/adjust paths in gulp/paths.js
